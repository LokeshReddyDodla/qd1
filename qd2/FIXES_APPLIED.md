# Fixes Applied for Embedding Timeout Issues

## 🔍 Problem Identified
- 412 meals were accepted and chunked successfully
- **0 were indexed** to Qdrant
- Error: `"Embedding/upsert error: timed out"`
- Root cause: OpenAI API timeout with large batches

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **embedding_service.py**
- ✅ Added **120-second timeout** for OpenAI client
- ✅ Added **automatic retry** (max 3 retries)
- ✅ Added **progress logging** for each batch
- ✅ Added per-batch timeout of 120 seconds

### 2. **config.py**
- ✅ Reduced batch size from **64 → 32** for better reliability
- ✅ Smaller batches = faster, more reliable embedding generation

### 3. **ingestion.py**
- ✅ Added detailed progress logging
- ✅ Shows estimated number of batches
- ✅ Logs each stage: embedding start → success → upsert
- ✅ Better error tracking and reporting

## 📊 Expected Behavior Now

### Large Dataset (e.g., 412 meals):
- **Before**: Timeout after ~30 seconds
- **After**: Processes in ~32 batches, takes 2-5 minutes total
- **Progress**: You'll see logs like:
  ```
  Generating embeddings batch 1/32
  Generating embeddings batch 2/32
  ...
  ✓ Embeddings generated successfully
  Upserting to Qdrant...
  Successfully indexed chunks
  ```

## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Restart the server:**
   ```bash
   # Press Ctrl+C to stop
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Try ingesting smaller batch first:**
   - Start with just 10-20 meal records
   - Verify they get indexed (check Qdrant: points_count > 0)

3. **Then try larger batch:**
   - Full 412 meals
   - Should take 2-5 minutes
   - Watch terminal for progress logs

## 📈 Monitoring Progress

Watch the terminal output for:
```
INFO: Generating embeddings batch 1/15
INFO: Generating embeddings batch 2/15
...
INFO: ✓ Embeddings generated successfully
INFO: Upserting to Qdrant chunks_count=480
INFO: Successfully indexed chunks indexed=480
```

## ⚠️ If Still Timing Out

If you still get timeouts with 412 meals:

### Option 1: Split the data
```bash
# Split into smaller files
jq -c '.[]' meal_reports.json | split -l 50 - meals_batch_

# Ingest each batch separately
```

### Option 2: Increase timeout further
Edit `.env`:
```
EMBEDDING_BATCH_SIZE=16  # Even smaller batches
```

### Option 3: Check OpenAI rate limits
- Free tier: 3,500 requests/day
- Paid tier: Higher limits
- Check: https://platform.openai.com/account/rate-limits

## ✅ Verification

After ingestion, check Qdrant dashboard:
- Go to: http://localhost:6333/dashboard
- Collection: `people_data`
- **Points count should be > 0** (not 0 like before)
